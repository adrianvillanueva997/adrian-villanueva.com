# Hello there!

Few days ago I got this domain and decided that maybe it is time to create a personal portfolio where I can show my
skills and talk about my personal projects or talk about technologies or stuff that I find interesting.

This website was planned to be made in Angular or React, due to the complexity of these frameworks and the fact that I
am not a frontend developer, I decided to use Golang (Gin Gonic), Go HTML templates and Markdown renderer to build these
posts.

If you want to check out the source code, feel free to do
so [here](https://github.com/adrianvillanueva997/adrian-villanueva.com)

I think the website is pretty much done (talking about the backend), maybe it could use a bit of CSS styling by adding
custom colors, but for now I like it the way it is now.

Thank you for reading! Have a nice day! :smile:
